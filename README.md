xinput-keylog
=============

Adapted from [St√©phane Chazelas's
answer](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/129171/45676) on Unix & Linux
SE. Some horrifying Perl, especially to a newbie, but it's pretty damned
effective in the original 17 lines.

My changes mainly consist of changing the format of the logs.
